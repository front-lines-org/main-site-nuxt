text: "The DPR declared its independence from Ukraine in May 2014 after the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, alongside the Luhansk People's Republic and the Republic of Crimea. An ongoing armed conflict between Ukraine and the DPR and LPR followed their declarations of independence. The LPR and DPR received assistance from Russia.[10][11] According to NATO and Ukraine, Russia had also provided military aid to the DPR rebels, a claim that Russia denies.[12] Ukraine regards both the DPR and the LPR as terrorist organizations,[13] although this designation is not supported by international bodies or governments (including the EU, US, and Russia).[14]"
