title: Fighting continues despite cease fire in Ukraine
shortDescription: Short description for this article
description: 'Chad has played a key role in Western anti-terrorism efforts in the Sahel for years. Warlord-President Idriss Déby fulfilled the role of military subcontractor with verve. Now that Déby has been killed by rebels last week, and a military junta has taken over power in the country, the question is whether Chad can maintain its military role in the region.'

### What is going on in the Donbas?

Fighting between Donetsk People's Republic separatist forces affiliated
with [Russia][], and [Ukrainian][] military and volunteer forces broke
out at [Donetsk International Airport][] on 28 September 2014, sparking
the **Second Battle of Donetsk Airport**, a part of the ongoing war in
the [Donbas region][] of [Ukraine][ukrainian]. This followed an [earlier
battle][] over control of the airport in May 2014, which left it in
Ukrainian hands. The new battle was sparked despite a ceasefire
agreement, the [Minsk Protocol][], that had been in place from 5
September. At the start of the battle, the airport was the last part of
[Donetsk][] city held by government forces, and it lies between the
separatist and Ukrainian lines of control. Heavy fighting over the
airport continued into the new year, with some of the worst fighting
having taken place in January 2015. On 21 January, separatist forces
overran the government's positions at the airport.<sup>[\[2\]][1]</sup>
The remaining Ukrainian forces were either killed, forced to retreat, or
captured.<sup>[\[22\]][2]</sup>
