### What is going on in the Donbas?

Fighting between Donetsk People's Republic separatist forces affiliated
with [Russia][], and [Ukrainian][] military and volunteer forces broke
out at [Donetsk International Airport][] on 28 September 2014, sparking
the **Second Battle of Donetsk Airport**, a part of the ongoing war in
the [Donbas region][] of [Ukraine][ukrainian]. This followed an [earlier
battle][] over control of the airport in May 2014, which left it in
Ukrainian hands. The new battle was sparked despite a ceasefire
agreement, the [Minsk Protocol][], that had been in place from 5
September. At the start of the battle, the airport was the last part of
[Donetsk][] city held by government forces, and it lies between the
separatist and Ukrainian lines of control. Heavy fighting over the
airport continued into the new year, with some of the worst fighting
having taken place in January 2015. On 21 January, separatist forces
overran the government's positions at the airport.<sup>[\[2\]][1]</sup>
The remaining Ukrainian forces were either killed, forced to retreat, or
captured.<sup>[\[22\]][2]</sup>
