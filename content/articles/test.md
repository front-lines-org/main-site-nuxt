title: Chad's role as flying keeper in Sahel uncertain after death of head of state'
description: 'Chad has played a key role in Western anti-terrorism efforts in the Sahel for years. Warlord-President Idriss Déby fulfilled the role of military subcontractor with verve. Now that Déby has been killed by rebels last week, and a military junta has taken over power in the country, the question is whether Chad can maintain its military role in the region.'

### What is going on in the Sahel?

In the thousands of kilometres wide region just south of the Sahara it has become increasingly unsafe in many places for years. Jihadist groups are gaining ground in countries without any strong central authority. Drug and human smugglers, with their eyes on Europe, also see their opportunities.

Particularly in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, the violence of Muslim extremists seems increasingly difficult to contain. More than 1.5 million people have already fled the terror. The jihadists' advance began in 2012 in Mali, where weapons flooded in after the fall of dictator Moammar Gaddafi in neighbouring Libya. From 2019, the violence exploded, with at least 4,000 people killed in hundreds of attacks in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso that year. And then there is Nigeria, where terrorist organisations have killed more than 37,000 people in the last ten years and driven more than 2.5 million from their homes.

### What exactly is Chad's role?

Some fourteen hundred Chadian soldiers operate under the flag of Minusma, the eight-year-old UN mission in Mali in which the Netherlands also took part earlier. Earlier this year, twelve hundred Chadians were dispatched to the turbulent border region of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. This took place within the framework of the G5 Sahel, an anti-terror coalition of five countries. On its own soil, near the border with Nigeria, Chadian soldiers are fighting intruders from the extremist groups Boko Haram and Islamic State in the West African province.

Because of his troop deployment, Idriss Déby, who came to power in a coup in 1990 and has always ruled with a heavy hand, became a crucial partner of the US and former coloniser France. One of his nicknames was 'the gendarme of the Sahel'. Its soldiers are trained by the French and the Americans. Chad also receives money: last year, together with the other countries of the G5 Sahel coalition, it received 112 million euros from the EU to strengthen its armed forces. Also significant: the headquarters of the 5,000-strong French military mission in the region is in N'Djamena, the capital of Chad.

### Is France still interested in cooperation after the death of Déby last week?

Paris is mainly pragmatic and would like Chad to continue its military contributions in the Sahel, regardless of who is in charge in Chad. If Chad withdraws its troops, the international missions will lose a large part of their power, precisely in a period in which the Élysée Palace itself wants to withdraw some of its troops. The protracted battle in, for example, Mali has cost the lives of at least 50 French soldiers since 2013.

President Emmanuel Macron therefore seized the funeral of Idriss Déby as an opportunity to strengthen ties. He praised Déby extensively, calling him a 'brave friend', and conveniently ignored the many human rights violations committed under Déby's rule. Macron also took the opportunity to talk to the leaders of the other countries in the anti-terror coalition G5 Sahel.

### What do the new rulers in Chad want?

Officially, power now rests with Déby's son, the 37-year-old four-star general Mahamat Déby. He heads a military 'transitional council' that promises new elections. But in the ensuing chaos, and after 31 years of unbroken rule by Déby senior, it is not inconceivable that a power struggle could break out at the top of the administration.



'That scenario could lead Déby junior to decide to bring the Chadian troops home,' says Remadji Hoinathy, a Chadian staff member at the Pan-African Institute for Security Studies. Hoinathy looks with concern at some generals who he says are now pursuing their own interests. They disagree with the new junta.

The fight against rebel group Fact may also be a reason for Déby junior to recall the Chadian military. According to the government, Fact is responsible for the death of father Déby, who was fatally wounded when he personally led an attack on the rebels in northern Chad last week.

If the rebels step up their offensive, Déby junior will need more troops. Hoinathy thinks it is difficult to estimate whether it will come to that. The rebels do have solid weaponry from neighbouring Libya, but they have also suffered significant losses in the recent fighting, he says.

### Should the French be worried already?

For a Chadian leader, cooperating with France has great advantages. Déby senior noticed this, for example, in 2019, when French fighter planes and drones dropped bombs on rebels who were advancing from the Chadian desert towards the presidential palace.

'Working with France gives you, as president of Chad, a kind of guarantee of power,' Hoinathy said. 'Why would you put that at risk? I think Mahamat Déby will only withdraw his troops if there is a really big threat to his position in the interior.'
